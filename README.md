# SNAPfob
SNAPfob is Synapse SM220-powered keyfob for interacting with SNAP networks. The current version has four buttons
and is designed to fit inside a [Polycase FB-45 keyfob enclosure](http://www.polycase.com/fb-45). The SNAPfob runs off of a single CR2032
and should be in a low-power sleep mode until a button press triggers an interrupt.
